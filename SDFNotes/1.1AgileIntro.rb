#1-1 AGILE METHODOLOGY: 

AGILE: 

Other Philosophies of Project Management: Waterfall vs. Agile

Principles of the Agile Philosophy:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

2. Working software over comprehensive dcoumentation.

3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

-> The customer is involved during the whole process of developing the product. 

4. Responding to change over following a plan.

-> Pivoting and changing features throughout the processes in order to not waste/throw away features at the end of the development because it's not going to be used by the customer anyway.

When to Embrace the Agile Philosophy: use when..

1. you don't have all the details for ongoing project
2. you need market feedback to continuously iterate on a project. 
3. time and financial constraints are more loose. 

When NOT to use Agile:

1. When a project is straight forward and does not need to be as fluid.

2. When a project that needs to be done quickly or is something that has been done in the past and can easily be iterated. 

But what about Scrum and Kanban:

Kanban: anyone can take charge of the meeting
1. Kanban helps teams visualize workflows and prioritze work -> shows to-do, in-progress, in QA, and done. 
  -> this helps the whole team as a whole to be mindful of everyone's progress.

2. Focuses on process improvement

3. Kanban board: Focuses on work in progress. 

Scrum: a scrum master takes charge of the meeting 
1. Scrum helps team quickly iterate.

2. Focuses on efficient work.

3. Burndown chart: focuses on remaining work.
